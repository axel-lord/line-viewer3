# Line Viewer 3

## What?

Simple application that displays the contents of a file, and copies lines to clipboard when clicked. File contents cannot be changed for that use a text editor.

## Why?

Common enough occurance for me to have, say, some filepaths or hyperlinks listed in a normal text file, this application makes it easier to copy these items and use them elsewhere.

## How?

Use cargo to build and either install or don't with cargo. No need to add it to path if you don't inted to use it from the command line, even in such a case it might be better to just alias the full path.
